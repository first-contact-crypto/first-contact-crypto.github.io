        <p>NOTICE OF ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</p>
        <p>Your use of the First Contact Crypto Sites and
            Features and our Services (as defined below) is subject to binding
            individual arbitration of any disputes which may arise, as provided in

            (https://www.FirstContactCrypto.com/terms). Please read the arbitration
            provisions carefully and do not use any of the First Contact Crypto Sites
            and Features or our Services if you are unwilling to arbitrate any
            disputes you may have with us (including without limitation any disputes
            relating to this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices) as provided in
            the Terms of Use.</p>
        <p>First Contact Crypto Inc (together with its
            affiliates, the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) owns and operates a number of
            different websites, FirstContactCrypto.com, mobile apps, and interactive
            services, and others (collectively, the &ldquo;FCC Sites&rdquo;). This
            privacy policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) applies to the FCC Sites
            and to all of the features, mobile applications, emails, online services
            and other functionalities (collectively, the &ldquo;Features&rdquo;)
            available via or related to the FCC Sites, whether accessed via a
            computer, mobile device, or otherwise (collectively, the &ldquo;FCC Sites
            and Features&rdquo;) and the services available on or through the FCC
            Sites and Features (the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy only
            covers information collected by the Company through the FCC Sites and
            Features and our Services, and does not cover any information received or
            collected offline by the Company (unless specifically stated) or
            collected by any unrelated websites or companies to which we may provide
            links.</p>
        <p>We are concerned about your privacy and want
            you to be familiar with how we collect, use and share your information.
            This Privacy Policy outlines the type of information that we collect and
            receive from you while you are using our Services. Additionally, this
            Privacy Policy identifies the ways in which we process, and sometimes
            share, such information and what control and choices you have with regard
            to the collection and use of your personal information. Please review
            this Privacy Policy carefully, especially before providing any personal
            information through the FCC Sites and Features. Our FCC Sites and
            Features are operated in and controlled from the United States of America
            unless otherwise stated. If you do not wish to have us collect, use and
            share information as described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use

        <p>By using any of the FCC Sites and Features or
            our Services, and/or clicking to &ldquo;Accept&rdquo; or otherwise
            acknowledging or consenting to this Privacy Policy where that option is
            made available to you, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy, as
            well as our Terms of Use (https://www.FirstContactCrypto.com/terms). If
            you do not agree to this Privacy Policy or our Terms, please do not use
            any FCC Sites or Features or our Services.</p>
        <p>Please don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact us with
            any questions regarding our Privacy Policy as provided in the
            &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; section below.</p>
        <p>Personal Information We Collect</p>
        <p>When you visit or use any of the FCC Sites and
            Features or our Services, you may be required to share information that
            identifies you personally. &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo; refers to
            any information that can reasonably be used to identify, contact or
            locate you. Examples of Personal Information may include, without
            limitation, your name, your location, your email address, your mailing
            address, and your phone number.</p>
        <p>Generally, we collect Personal Information
            when you provide it to us by visiting the FCC Sites and Features or using
            our Services. This may include registering for any account with us,
            filling out surveys, joining a mailing list, corresponding with us,
            entering one of our sweepstakes or contests, choosing to submit
            testimonials, stories, photos or the like, or otherwise volunteering or
            providing information about yourself.</p>
        <p>We may use your Personal Information and other
            information we collect about you in order to provide you with our
            Services, to improve the FCC Sites and Features, to provide advertising,
            content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards, and for other
            marketing, administrative and general business purposes as described in
            this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>If you don&rsquo;t provide us with your
            Personal Information, we will generally be unable to provide you with our
            Services and you will be unable to use the FCC Sites and Features.
        </p>
        <p>Other User Information We Collect</p>
        <p>We may collect certain other information each
            time you visit FCC Sites and Features or use our Services so we can
            improve the overall quality of your online experience. This kind of
            information is not ordinarily considered personally identifying
            information. For example, we collect or may collect your IP address,
            device ID, referrer data, and browser and platform type. You do not have
            to register on any of the FCC Sites and Features or provide any Personal
            Information to us before we can collect this information. We may assign
            an ID number to your registration and link additional data to that ID
            number, such as the date and time you visited, the information you
            provide, and the links you choose to click. Like most standard website
            servers, we use log files to collect and store this user information. We
            may analyze and use this information for a variety of purposes, including
            operating and improving the FCC Sites and Features or our Services,
            collecting further information about and learning from user behavior and
            trends, and gathering demographic information. Furthermore, we may
            combine or link the information we collect from or about you offline with
            information we collect from or about you online through the FCC Sites and
            Features or your use of our Services.</p>
        <p>You may choose to install and use optional
            browser extensions, add-ons or similar plug-in technologies (the
            &ldquo;Extensions&rdquo;) which may also collect and use your information
            in a variety of ways. For example, an extension may allow you to shop
            directly with a merchant partner and earn rewards. If you install
            Extensions, we may be able to determine automatically when you are
            visiting one of our merchant partners&rsquo; websites where our rewards
            may apply. In addition, to assist in rewarding you for purchases made
            through our shopping-rewards features, third-party affiliate or ad
            network cookies or other similar technologies (discussed below) may be
            placed on your computer when you install and use an Extension or when you
            click on an affiliate or ad network link within a shopping-rewards
            feature, your browsing activity on our merchant partners&rsquo; websites
            (and, with your consent, other websites) may be tracked, and that
            information may be shared with our advertisers, merchant and survey
            partners, or others in order to provide you with advertising, content,
            surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards, or for other marketing,
            administrative and general business purposes.</p>
        <p>In addition, our mobile applications may
            collect, among other things, certain information automatically,
            including, but not limited to the type of mobile device you use, your
            mobile device&rsquo;s unique device identifier (UDID), the IP address of
            your mobile device, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile
            Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use the
            mobile application.</p>
        <p>Information We Receive from Third
            Parties</p>
        <p>We may also receive and supplement the
            information we directly collect from or about you with information from
            third parties. If you are on a third party website or service and you
            opt-in to receive information from us, the third party may forward to us
            your e-mail address and other information about you so that we may
            contact you as requested. In addition, we may receive information from
            advertisers, merchant or survey partners, and others to ensure that you
            properly receive any earned rewards or for other marketing,
            administrative or general business purposes. We may also supplement and
            combine the information we collect about you with outside records from
            third parties in order to enhance our ability to provide you with
            advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards, and for
            other business purposes.</p>
        <p>Friend Referrals</p>
        <p>We may provide you with an opportunity to
            invite your friends, family, and acquaintances (&ldquo;Friends&rdquo;) to
            use various FCC Sites and Features. If you elect to use our referral
            service for informing a Friend about any of the FCC Sites and Features,
            you may provide us with your Friend&rsquo;s name and email address. Using
            our referral service permits us to automatically send the Friend email or
            other communications, on your behalf, inviting them to visit or register
            for the FCC Sites and Features. You warrant and represent that you have
            your Friend&rsquo;s consent to provide us with his or her information for
            this purpose, and that you will not give us referral information for any
            person not permitted to use the FCC Sites and Features, including,
            without limitation a child under the age of 18, a person whose account
            has previously been suspended or deactivated, or a person residing or

            chat rooms, forums, interactive features, third-party social networking
            services or other communication functionality (&ldquo;Community
            Features&rdquo;). Please note that certain information, such as your

            Features is public &mdash; others will have access to that User Content
            and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to
            voluntarily disclose Personal Information in the User Content, that
            information will be considered public information and the protections of
            this Privacy Policy will no longer apply to that information. In
            addition, by posting through our Community Features, you are agreeing
            that we may use your User Content and excerpts from your User Content in

            the like, third parties may collect your information based on your
            interaction with those offers. Third-party privacy practices are not
            covered by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for the
            privacy practices of such third parties. We encourage our users to be
            aware of and to read the privacy statements and similar disclosures of
            any third-party website that collects personally identifiable information
            before using or disclosing any personally identifiable information to
            such website.</p>
        <p>Advertising Networks and Analytics
            Companies</p>
        <p>We may allow other companies, commonly called
            third-party ad servers or advertising networks (collectively, &ldquo;ad
            networks&rdquo;), to display advertisements on the FCC Sites and
            Features. These advertisements may be based on your interests as
            reflected in your use of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services, as
            well as your use of other websites and services. Some of these ad
            networks may place a persistent cookie or other similar technology on
            your computer, allowing them to recognize your computer each time they
            send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile
            information about where you see their advertisements online and determine
            which ads you click on, so that they may provide you with advertising,
            content, surveys, offers, promotions, and rewards that they believe will
            be of most interest to you. We do not have access to or control over the
            cookies or other similar technologies that may be placed by these parties
            on your computer, nor do we have responsibility for these parties&rsquo;
            privacy policies or information collection practices. Likewise, we may
            use certain third-party analytics providers to help us understand how you
            use the FCC Sites and Features or our Services, and these companies may
            set their own cookies and similar technologies on your computer or mobile
            device. These and other third parties may collect information about you,
            including but not limited to your online activities over time and across
            different websites and services when you use the FCC Sites and Features
            or our Services, or other online websites and services. Each of these
            third parties has its own privacy policy that may differ from this
            Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>We may share your Personal Information and
            other information with our advertisers, merchant and survey partners, and
            others for the purpose of making it easier for you to sign up for their
            surveys, promotions and offers, validating your communications or
            transactions with them, authenticating and/or validating your
            identification, crediting you with any earned rewards, and other business
            purposes. Additionally, we may share information with our service
            providers and other third parties to assist us in delivering content,
            advertising, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards to you, both on the
            FCC Sites and Features, and for other marketing, administrative and
            general business purposes.</p>
        <p>Cookies and Similar Technologies</p>
        <p>In addition to the ad networks, we may set (or
            allow third parties to set) and access cookies and other similar
            technologies on your computer. A cookie is a small data file that a
            website may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your
            system. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the
            session cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie terminates. A
            persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an
            extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed or disabled by
            following the web browser help-file directions for your particular
            browser. Cookies may be used for various purposes, including, without
            limitation, enabling a feature and remembering your preferences. Cookies
            may be used on the FCC Sites and Features for a variety of analytical
            purposes and to help us provide a better and more customized user
            experience, including, without limitation, providing personalized
            features and preferences to you within the FCC Sites and Features; in
            doing so, we may link the information we collect from cookies and other
            similar technologies with your Personal Information in order to provide
            you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards,
            and for other marketing, administrative and general business
            purposes.</p>

            is a consensus among industry participants as to what &ldquo;Do Not
            Track&rdquo; means in this context. Like many websites and online
            services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a
            &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signal from a user&rsquo;s browser. To find
            out more about &ldquo;Do Not Track,&rdquo; you may wish to visit

        <p>Social Features</p>
        <p>Certain functionality on the FCC Sites and
            Features may permit interactions that you initiate between the FCC Sites
            and Features and a third-party website or service, such as Facebook and
            Twitter (&ldquo;Social Features&rdquo;). Examples of Social Features
            &nbsp;may include enabling you to &ldquo;like&rdquo; or
            &ldquo;share&rdquo; content from the FCC Sites and Features with other
            websites or services; to log-in to the FCC Sites and Features using your
            username and password for a third-party website or service; to transmit
            content to the FCC Sites and Features from your account on a third-party
            website or service; and to otherwise connect the FCC Sites and Features
            to a third-party website or service.</p>
        <p>If you choose to use Social Features, the
            information you post or provide access to will be shared with that
            third-party website or service and possibly others and may be publicly
            displayed on the FCC Sites and Features or by the provider of the Social
            Feature that you use. Similarly, if you post information on a third-party
            platform that references any of the FCC Sites and Features (e.g., by
            using a hashtag associated with any of the FCC Sites and Features in a
            tweet or status update), your post may be published on the FCC Sites and
            Features in accordance with the terms of the third-party website or
            service. Also, both we and the third party may have access to certain
            information about you and your use of the FCC &nbsp;Sites and Features
            and the third-party website or service. In addition, we may receive
            information about you if other users of a third-party website give us
            access to their profiles and you are one of their
            &ldquo;connections,&rdquo; or information about you is otherwise
            accessible through your connections&rsquo; web pages, profile pages, or
            similar pages on a social networking or other third-party website or
            service.</p>
        <p>The information we collect in connection with
            Social Features is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information
            collected and stored by the third-party website or service via Social
            Features remains subject to the third party&rsquo;s privacy practices,
            including whether the third party continues to share information with us,
            the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is
            visible to others on that third-party website or service.</p>
        <p>Sharing</p>
        <p>In addition to the types of sharing described
            throughout this Privacy Policy, we may disclose your Personal Information
            and other information as described in this section.</p>
        <p>We may be forced to disclose your Personal
            Information when required by law, or where we have a good-faith belief
            that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial or administrative
            proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process
            served on us. We may also share your Personal Information at the request
            of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, or if we believe
            it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
            regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
            potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of
            the Terms of Use or Privacy Policy for any of the FCC Sites and Features
            or our Services. We may also use IP addresses or other device identifiers
            to identify users, and we may do so in cooperation with copyright owners,
            Internet service providers, wireless service providers, or law
            enforcement agencies in our discretion. These transfers and disclosures
            may occur without notice to you.</p>
        <p>We may also share your Personal Information
            with our affiliates for administrative, marketing and other business
            purposes, and with third-party service providers in connection with the
            service providers&rsquo; performance of services to, or on behalf of, the
            FCC Sites and Features or our Services. Such services include, for
            example, customer support, collecting and analyzing information about
            usage of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services, delivering
            advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions and rewards to you on
            the FCC Sites and Features or elsewhere online, processing payments, and
            performing other administrative, marketing and other business
            services.</p>
        <p>We may share aggregate or individualized
            information that may include your use of the Prodege Sites and Features
            or our Services and our merchant partners&rsquo; websites, with our
            advertisers, merchant and survey partners, and others for the purpose of
            providing you with advertising, content, surveys, offers, promotions, and
            rewards, and for other marketing, administrative and general business
            purposes, and we may also receive from ad networks information about
            third-party websites that you have visited.</p>
        <p>The information about you that we share with
            or receive from third parties may generally be used for marketing,
            administrative and other business purposes.</p>
        <p>Business Transitions</p>
        <p>In the event the Company (or any of its
            affiliates) goes through a business transition, such as a merger,
            consolidation, restructuring, acquisition by another company, sale or
            assignment of rights or assets or a portion thereof, or other company
            change, we may transfer users&rsquo; information, including Personal
            Information, and other business data in connection with that business
            transition (e.g., to a subsequent owner, co-owner, or operator of any of
            the FCC Sites and Features, or any affiliates and trusted agents, service
            providers, or partners of the foregoing), including during the course of
            any due diligence process.</p>
        <p>Updating Your Information;
            Choice/Opt-out</p>
        <p>You are responsible for maintaining the
            accuracy of any information you submit to us, such as your contact
            information.</p>
        <p>You may opt out of receiving marketing e-mails
            by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those e-mails,
            by visiting &ldquo;My Settings&rdquo;, &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; or similar
            link on the relevant FCC Site, or by contacting us as provided in the
            &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; section below. Please note that as long as you
            remain registered with or a user of any of the FCC Sites and Features or
            our Services, even if you opt-out of marketing emails, you may still
            receive administrative emails, such as notices about service and status
            changes and changes to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>If you sign up to receive SMS or MMS messages
            from the FCC Sites and Features, you may unsubscribe from any SMS or MMS
            messages received by replying &ldquo;STOP&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>If you do not wish to receive advertisements,
            content, surveys, promotions, offers, or rewards from us which would be
            sent to you by virtue of your having installed the Extensions, you should
            not install or should un-install such Extensions. In addition, you may
            remove or disable cookies as described above in the section on
            &ldquo;Cookies and Similar Technologies&rdquo; and you may clear your
            browser history in accordance with the system settings of your web
            browser.</p>
        <p>Certain advertising networks and exchanges may
            participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (&ldquo;DAA&rdquo;)
            AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for
            interest-based ads. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program
            here: http://www.youradchoices.com. In addition, certain advertising
            networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising
            Initiative (NAI). The NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to
            opt out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI members&rsquo; ad
            networks. To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to
            use the tool, click here:

        <p>If you do not want our mobile applications to
            collect any information from you, you should uninstall the application
            using the standard uninstall procedures that may be available as part of

        <p>Notification of Changes</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to make changes to this
            Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy
            Policy, we will provide notice of such changes by sending you an
            administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the
            Prodege Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are
            always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
            what circumstances it may be shared with others. Your continued use of
            any of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services after delivery of the
            administrative email to you or after the changes are posted constitutes
            your agreement to the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, please
            discontinue your use of such FCC Sites and Features and our Services. To
            the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction
            determines that applying any changes to this Privacy Policy to any prior
            events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable
            contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only,
            with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such
            changes, to the extent necessary to avoid this Privacy Policy being
            deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if any Personal
            Information was previously submitted to or collected by us pursuant to an
            earlier version of this Privacy Policy that required a certain notice
            period prior to any changes being effective, any changes under this
            Privacy Policy will not be effective as to you or such
            previously-collected Personal Information until the previously-specified
            notice period has passed after the date of this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
        <p>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</p>
        <p>The FCC Sites and Features and our Services
            are general audience websites and services for users at least 18 years of
            age or and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from
            children younger than the age of 13. If you are under 18, you should NOT
            use FCC Sites and Features and our Services. If you are under 13, you
            should not submit any Personal Information to us. If we learn that we
            have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child younger
            than 13, we will take commercially reasonable efforts to delete such
            Personal Information from our databases.</p>
        <p>Security</p>
        <p>We maintain security measures in place in
            order to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of
            the Personal Information under our control. Please be advised, however,
            that the Internet and other various networking communication media are
            not entirely secure, and your information may, therefore, be subject to
            interception or loss which is beyond our reasonable control. While we
            strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant
            the security of any Personal Information you transmit to us, and any
            transmission is done at your own risk. Accordingly, we assume no
            responsibility or liability for disclosure of your Personal Information
            or other information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized
            third-party access or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
        </p>
        <p>Location of Processing and Applicable
            Law</p>
        <p>Although we generally maintain our user data
            in the United States, it is possible that some of the data processing may
            occur outside of the United States, carried out by companies or
            individuals under contract with us. While the data protection laws of
            these countries may vary, we will make every reasonable effort to protect
            your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. By using the FCC
            Sites and Features and our Services, you consent to this transfer of your
            personal data to any server used by the Company or its service providers
            from time to time.</p>
        <p>If you are not a resident of the United
            States, please be aware that data protection laws in the United States
            and other countries (as well as the legal procedures for courts,
            governmental authorities, and parties in civil litigation to obtain
            access to our user data) may differ substantially from the laws and
            procedures in your country of residence. If you are located in a country
            outside the United States and submit Personal Information to us, you are
            consenting to the transfer, processing, storage and use of that
            information in the United States as provided in this Privacy
            Policy.</p>
        <p>The interpretation and application of this
            Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the
            State of Colorado without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Your
            use of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services are not intended to
            subject us to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country or territory
            other than that of the United States.</p>
        <p>Your California Privacy Rights (California
            Residents)</p>
        <p>When California residents provide certain
            personal information to a business, they have the right under California
            Civil Code Section 1798.83 to request certain disclosures if that
            business shares that personal information with third parties, and in some
            cases affiliates, for the third parties&rsquo; or affiliates&rsquo;
            direct marketing purposes. Once per calendar year California residents
            may request that the business provide a list of companies with which it
            shares such personal information for the third parties&rsquo; or
            affiliates&rsquo; direct marketing purposes, and a list of the categories
            of such personal information that the business shares.</p>
        <p>California residents may request further
            information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing

            required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not
            required to respond to requests made by means other than through this
            e-mail address, or made by non-California residents.</p>
