            improve the overall quality of your online experience. This kind of

            in a variety of ways. For example, an extension may allow you to shop
            directly with a merchant partner and earn rewards. If you install
            Extensions, we may be able to determine automatically when you are
            visiting one of our merchant partners&rsquo; websites where our rewards

            feature, your browsing activity on our merchant partners&rsquo; websites
            (and, with your consent, other websites) may be tracked, and that

            Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to change this Privacy
            Policy, we will provide notice of such changes by sending you an
            administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the
            Prodege Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are
            always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under
            what circumstances it may be shared with others. Your continued use of
            any of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services after delivery of the
            administrative email to you or after the changes are posted constitutes
            your agreement to the changes. If you do not agree to the changes, please
            discontinue your use of such FCC Sites and Features and our Services. To
            the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction
            determines that applying any changes to this Privacy Policy to any prior
            events or circumstances would render this an illusory or unenforceable
            contract, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis only,
            with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the date of such
            changes, to the extent necessary to avoid this Privacy Policy being
            deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if any Personal
            Information was previously submitted to or collected by us pursuant to an
            earlier version of this Privacy Policy that required a certain notice
            period prior to any changes being effective, any changes under this
            Privacy Policy will not be effective as to you or such
            previously-collected Personal Information until the previously-specified
            notice period has passed after the date of this Privacy Policy.</span>
