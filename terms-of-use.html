        provisions carefully and do not use any of the First Contact Crypto

        disputes you may have with us (including without limitation any disputes
        relating to these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, and any Additional
        Terms) as provided herein.</p>

        permission.
        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all rights not

        and
        remain always with the Company. Your right to use the FCC Sites and

      <p>If you are accessing the FCC Sites and

        (collectively &ldquo;Third Party Outlets&rdquo;) including, without
        limitation, Apple, Inc.&rsquo;s &ldquo;App Store&rdquo; or Google,

      <p>Any sweepstakes, contests or promotions
        (collectively, &ldquo;Promotions&rdquo;) that may be offered via any of
        the FCC Sites and Features or our Services may be governed by Additional
        Terms, which may set out eligibility requirements, such as certain age
        or
        geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions, and details
        governing
        how your personal information may be used. It is your responsibility to
        read all Additional Terms to determine whether or not you want to or are

      <p>4. Rewards Programs</p>
      <p>Overview</p>
      <p>The Company may offer one or more rewards
        programs (&ldquo;Rewards Programs&rdquo;) under which you may have the
        opportunity to earn points (in the FirstContactCrypto.com program, such
        points are called &ldquo;Epiphany Points,&rdquo; &ldquo;EPs&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;Points&rdquo;), which are redeemable for rewards. Rewards
        Programs
        may include Additional Terms that apply to your participation in
        activities allowing you to earn points (collectively,
        &ldquo;Activities&rdquo;). The Company may limit, suspend or terminate
        your ability to participate in a Rewards Program in its sole and
        absolute
        discretion, and may void any points, rewards, or potential rewards you
        may have earned or accumulated in a Rewards Program, if we determine in
        our sole discretion that you have not complied with these Terms or any
        Additional Terms applicable to such participation. You agree to abide by
        the final and binding decisions of the Company regarding any Rewards
        Program and your participation in it. We reserve the right to change,
        suspend, or cancel all or a portion of a Rewards Program, including any
        points you may have accrued, at any time without prior notice to
        you.</p>
      <p>Earning Points</p>
      <p>Points can be earned in a Rewards Program by
        participating in certain Activities, as described in the applicable FCC
        Sites and Features. If you choose to participate and follow the
        instructions associated with an Activity, upon satisfying all of the
        requirements of the Activity, you will be awarded the points associated
        with completing that Activity so long as the Company and/or its
        third-party Rewards Program affiliates are able to properly track your
        valid and completed point-earning Activities. For avoidance of doubt,
        Company shall not be responsible for, nor shall Company be obligated to
        award points or rewards to Rewards Program participants for, any
        Activity
        that is not properly recorded, tracked and/or deemed approved under
        Company&rsquo;s or its third-party Rewards Program affiliates&rsquo;
        policies, procedures and systems. There may be limitations on Activities
        and rewards, so please be sure to review all applicable Additional Terms
        before deciding whether or not you would like to participate. For
        example, we reserve the right to request and verify receipts of
        completed
        purchases prior to or in connection with the awarding of points for
        shopping Activities in order to verify with the applicable merchant that
        such purchases are valid. Some of the limitations on Activities and
        rewards include (without limitation), our right to change or limit your
        ability to participate in certain Activities or the Rewards Program
        itself; our right to change or limit the allowable frequency of
        Activities; our right to change or limit the number of points you can
        earn for a given Activity or during a given time period; and our right
        to
        change the Activities or rewards available, or the number of points
        required for a particular reward. Points awarded have no cash
        value.</p>
      <p>Redeeming Points</p>
      <p>You may redeem points you have earned for
        rewards offered in a Rewards Program pursuant to these Terms and any
        applicable Additional Terms. Supplies may be limited. Rewards may be
        awarded on a first-come, first-serve and while-supplies-last basis. If
        you attempt to redeem points for a reward and the Company determines
        that
        the reward is unavailable, out of stock, or for whatever reason cannot
        be
        provided to you, the Company may, at its sole and absolute discretion,
        provide you with a reward of equal or greater value. No credit,
        reversal,
        or refund of points will be issued for any reason after points have been
        redeemed; in other words, once you order a reward, you may not cancel
        the
        reward or return the reward for a refund of points. The only way to use
        points is to redeem them for Rewards Program rewards as available from
        time to time through the FirstContact Crypto.com Redemption after login.
        Some rewards may have eligibility requirements and in that case the
        Company reserves the right to verify your identity (by requesting
        photocopy of your driver&rsquo;s license or state ID card, or other
        proof
        as we may require) and eligibility qualifications to our complete
        satisfaction prior to crediting points or fulfilling any reward in any
        Rewards Program, or otherwise providing you with any benefit.</p>
      <p>Delivery of Rewards</p>
      <p>Rewards may be emailed to your email address
        or mailed to the U.S. postal address, as applicable, that you provided
        when you registered and created an account (&ldquo;Account&rdquo;) for
        the applicable Rewards Program, or to the email or U.S. postal address
        that our records show your Account was last updated to reflect.
        Processing times may vary. Rewards that are undeliverable or unclaimed
        for whatever reason (including, without limitation, because your Account
        information is incorrect or outdated) may be forfeited, and the points
        will not be refunded.</p>
      <p>Rewards Program Points Nontransferable</p>
      <p>Rewards Program points are non transferable,
        may not be bartered or sold, and are void if a transfer is attempted,
        and
        such points and the associated Account are not transferable upon death,
        as part of a domestic relations matter or otherwise by operation of
        law.</p>
      <p>Inactive Accounts</p>
      <p>Any Account that has not been logged into and
        points either earned or redeemed for one year or more may be deemed
        inactive and the Account closed. In such instances, to request Account
        reactivation (subject to such terms, limitations and requirements as we
        may impose from time to time) you may reach us by using the
        &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo;, &ldquo;Contact Member Services&rdquo; or
        similar contact link in the footer of any of the FCC Sites. We may
        modify
        our inactive Account rules and policies in our Rewards Programs from
        time
        to time, and if your Account becomes inactive pursuant to such

        available via the FCC Sites and Features or our Services, and/or (vii)
        tax liability imposed against you by any taxing authority.</p>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable
        law, in no event will the Company, or its affiliates, partners,
        employees, and agents, be liable to you or any third person for any
        special, direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or
        consequential damages whatsoever, including any lost profits or lost
        data
        arising from your use of the FCC Sites and Features, our Services or

        of monetary value, in the event there is any: change in the value of

        data or server error, computer and/or network system error or failure,
        criminal act, vandalism, cyber-attack or other events which make it
        commercially unreasonable for us to determine the points balance or

      <p>Please note that at any time, we may, in our
        sole discretion, terminate our legal agreement with you and deny you
        continued use of the FCC Sites and Features and our Services, and,
        without limiting the foregoing, may do so if (i) we are required to do
        so
        by law (for example, where the provision of our services to you is, or
        may become, unlawful); (ii) the partner with whom we offered our
        Services
        to you has terminated its relationship with us or ceased to offer their
        services to you; (iii) we are no longer providing all or any portion of

      <p>10. Compliance with FTC Guidelines on
        Endorsements/Testimonials</p>
      <p>If you choose to promote our services to the
        public, including your own personal social networks, you agree that you
        will comply with the FTC&rsquo;s Guidelines Concerning the Use of
        Testimonials and Endorsements in Advertising (available at
        https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-publishes-final-guides-governing-endorsements-testimonials/091005revisedendorsementguides.pdf)
        (&ldquo;Guidelines&rdquo;).</p>
      <p>For example, if you have been paid or provided
        with free products in exchange for discussing or promoting a FCC product
        or service, or if you are an employee of a company and you decide to
        discuss or promote that company&rsquo;s products or services through the
        FCC services, you agree to comply with the Guidelines&rsquo;
        requirements
        for disclosing such relationships. You, and not FCC, are solely
        responsible for any endorsements or testimonials you make regarding any
        product or service made on or through FCC&rsquo;s services.</p>
      <p>11. Binding Arbitration of all Disputes</p>
      <p>A. Providing Notice of a Claim. The parties
        agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between them (&ldquo;Disputes
        or Claims&rdquo;). This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly
        interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (1) Disputes or Claims
        related in any way to any FCC Sites and Features or our Service,
        privacy,
        data security, collection, use and sharing, advertising, purchase
        transactions, points earnings, awards, balances, expiration, or
        transactions, sweepstakes, promotions, or any emails, texts, or other
        communications with you; (2) Disputes or Claims arising out of or
        relating to any aspect of the transactions or relationship between us,
        whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or
        any
        other legal theory; (3) Disputes or Claims that arose before your
        agreement to these Terms of Use or any prior arbitration agreement; (4)
        Disputes or Claims that are currently the subject of purported class
        action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class;
        and
        (5) Disputes or Claims that may arise after the termination of your use
        of any FCC Sites and Features or our Services.</p>
      <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must
        first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute
        (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). Notice to us must be sent to our customer
        service
        address at: FCC Dispute Resolution, First Contact Crypto Inc. , 415
        Coffman Street, Longmont, CO 80501, Attention: Legal Department. The
        Notice must include: (1) the nature and basis of your Dispute or Claim;
        (2) identification or enclosure of all relevant documents and
        information; and (3) a description of the specific relief that you seek
        from us.</p>
      <p>B. Providing Us an Opportunity to Informally
        Resolve Your Dispute.</p>
      <p>C. Agreement to Participate in Binding
        Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an informal resolution of your
        Dispute or Claim within thirty (30) days after we receive your written
        Notice, you may pursue your Dispute or Claim in arbitration or, solely
        to
        the extent specifically provided below, in small claims court. If the
        parties cannot reach an informal resolution to the Dispute or Claim
        within thirty (30) days after our receipt of your Notice, you may
        commence an arbitration proceeding by sending an arbitration demand
        (&ldquo;Arbitration Demand&rdquo;) to the following address: FCC Dispute
        Resolution, First Contact Crypto Inc. , 415 Coffman Street, Longmont, CO
        80501, Attention: Legal Department. The parties agree to arbitrate any
        Dispute or Claim between them, except to the extent either party chooses
        to instead pursue the Dispute or Claim in small claims court as provided
        below. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration
        uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more
        limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review
        by
        courts. Arbitrators generally can award the same damages and relief that
        a court can award.</p>
      <p>Except as otherwise provided herein, upon
        either party filing an Arbitration Demand, we will pay all filing,
        administration, and arbitrator fees, unless your Dispute or Claim
        exceeds
        $75,000 (exclusive of any filing, administration, arbitrator, or
        attorneys&rsquo; fees or other fees or expenses). If you initiate an
        arbitration in which you seek more than $75,000 (exclusive of any
        filing,
        administration, arbitrator, or attorneys&rsquo; fees or other fees or
        expenses) in damages, the American Arbitration Association&rsquo;s
        (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary
        Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the &ldquo;AAA
        Rules&rdquo;) will govern the payment of these fees. The AAA Rules, as
        modified by these Rules, will govern the arbitration. The AAA Rules are
        available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at
        1-800-778-7879.
        If your Dispute or Claim is for $10,000 or less (exclusive of any
        filing,
        administration, arbitrator, or attorneys&rsquo; fees or other fees or
        expenses), we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be
        conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator,
        through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA
        Rules. If your Dispute or Claim exceeds $10,000 (exclusive of any
        filing,
        administration, arbitrator, or attorneys&rsquo; fees or other fees or
        expenses), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules.
        Furthermore, if AAA at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum
        Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations in effect
        which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, the Company agrees
        to
        provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they
        are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth
        in this arbitration provision, provided, however, that in no event may
        such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of
        language
        in bold type below requiring individual arbitration and prohibiting
        class, representative or consolidated arbitration proceedings.</p>
      <p>Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing,
        any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) in
        which you reside (except that, if you reside outside of the United
        States, any such hearings will take place in Denver, Colorado). One
        arbitrator, who is selected under the AAA Rules and who has expertise in
        consumer disputes in the Internet industry, will conduct the
        arbitration.
        If no arbitrator possessing such expertise is available, then the
        arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who is selected by
        the mutual written approval of the parties. Except as allowed under
        applicable law and the AAA Rules, the decisions of the arbitrator will
        be
        binding and conclusive on all parties. Judgment upon any award of the
        arbitrator may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. This
        provision will be specifically enforceable in any court. THE ARBITRATOR
        MUST FOLLOW THESE RULES AND CAN AWARD THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A
        COURT (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS&rsquo; FEES).</p>
      <p>All issues are for the arbitrator to decide,
        except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the
        arbitration provision are for a court to decide. Regardless of the
        manner
        in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a
        reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings
        and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise
        provided
        herein, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for
        any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements
        above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of
        your Dispute or Claim or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for
        an
        improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule
        of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be
        governed by the AAA Rules. Also, if you initiate an arbitration in which
        you seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of fees will be
        governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
      <p>We may make a written settlement offer to you
        before the arbitrator issues an award. If, after the arbitrator finds in
        your favor on the merits of the claim, and the arbitrator issues you an
        award that is greater than our written offer, we will: (1) pay you the
        greater of the amount of the award or $7,500 (&ldquo;Alternative
        Payment&rdquo;); and (2) pay your attorney, if you use an attorney,
        twice
        the amount of any reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees awarded by the
        arbitrator, and reimburse any expenses that your attorney reasonably
        accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your arbitration
        claim
        (&ldquo;Attorney Fee Premium&rdquo;). The Attorney Fee Premium does not
        supplant any right you may have to reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees
        under
        applicable law. Thus, if you would be entitled to a greater amount under
        applicable law, the Attorney Fee Premium does not preclude the
        arbitrator
        from awarding you that amount. You may not, however, recover duplicative
        attorneys&rsquo; fees or costs. If we do not make a written settlement
        offer to you before the arbitrator issues an award, you and your
        attorney
        will be entitled to the Alternative Payment and the Attorney Fee
        Premium,
        respectively, if the arbitrator decides in your favor on the merits. We
        agree that we will not seek any award of attorneys&rsquo; fees, even if
        we are entitled to such fees. The arbitrator may make any determinations
        and resolve any Dispute or Claim as to the payment and reimbursement of
        fees, the Alternative Payment, or the Attorney Fee Premium at any time
        during the proceeding and within fourteen (14) days after the
        arbitrator&rsquo;s final ruling on the merits. The arbitrator may award
        declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
        seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
        warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim. Furthermore, these
        arbitration provisions shall not prevent any party from seeking
        provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate
        jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT:</p>
      <p>ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE
        CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS OR
        REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. NEITHER YOU NOR COMPANY SHALL BE A MEMBER IN A
        CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, AND THE
        ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY
        SEEKING
        RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY
        THAT PARTY&rsquo;S INDIVIDUAL DISPUTE OR CLAIM.</p>
      <p>UNLESS BOTH PARTIES AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
        ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&rsquo;S DISPUTES OR
        CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE
        OR CLASS PROCEEDING.</p>
      <p>COMPANY DOES NOT CONSENT TO CLASS ARBITRATION.
        ACCORDINGLY, IF A COURT REFUSES TO ENFORCE THE ABOVE PROVISIONS
        REGARDING
        CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL
        BE UNENFORCEABLE AS TO YOU. WHETHER A DISPUTE OR CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT
        OR IN ARBITRATION, YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY
        TRIAL.</p>
      <p>This arbitration agreement covers any Dispute
        or Claim arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship
        between the parties, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
        misrepresentation or any other legal theory, even if the Dispute or
        Claim
        arises or may arise before or after the period(s) during which you are
        using the FCC Sites and Features or our Services. For purposes of this
        arbitration provision, references to &ldquo;the Company&rdquo;,
        &ldquo;we&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; include First Contact Crypto Inc.,
        and each of their affiliates, and each such entity&rsquo;s respective
        directors, officers, employees, shareholders, agents, suppliers and
        assignees. The AAA Rules evidence a transaction in interstate commerce
        and the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
        enforcement of this section.</p>
      <p>The parties must bring any Dispute or Claim
        hereunder (including any Dispute or Claim arising out of or related to
        the AAA Rules), within two (2) years after the Dispute or Claim arises,
        or the Dispute or Claim will be permanently barred. To the extent the
        law
        applicable under the Governing Law section below makes this limitations
        period unenforceable with respect to any Dispute(s) or Claim(s), then
        the
        statutes of limitations of the state whose laws govern the AAA Rules
        under the Governing Law section below shall apply.</p>
      <p>We may make changes to this arbitration
        provision from time to time. You may reject any material changes by
        sending us written objection within thirty (30) days of the change to
        First Contact Crypto Dispute Resolution, First Contact Crypto Inc. , 415
        Coffman Street, Longmont, CO 80501, Attention: Legal Department. By
        rejecting any future material change, you are agreeing to arbitrate in
        accordance with the language of this provision. If you do not send
        written objection to any change as provided above, you are agreeing to
        arbitration in accordance with the changed language of this provision.
        To
        the extent that an arbitrator or court of applicable jurisdiction
        determines that applying any changes to this arbitration provision to
        any
        Disputes or Claims relating to prior events or circumstances would
        render
        this an illusory or unenforceable contract or otherwise violate your
        legal rights, such changes shall be applicable on a prospective basis
        only, with respect to events or circumstances occurring after the
        effective date of such changes, and in that case any Disputes or Claims
        relating to such prior events or circumstances shall be arbitrated in
        accordance with the language of this provision without such changes to
        the extent necessary to avoid these Terms being deemed illusory or
        unenforceable.</p>
      <p>D. Small Claims Court.You may choose to pursue
        your Dispute or Claim in small claims court rather than by arbitration
        if
        your Dispute or Claim qualifies for small claims court in a location
        where jurisdiction and venue over you and us is proper.</p>
      <p>E. Governing Law.The AAA Rules, and any
        Dispute or Claim arising between you and the Company related in any way
        to the AAA Rules or any FCC Sites and Features or our Service, privacy,
        data security, collection, use and sharing, advertising, purchase
        transactions, points earnings, awards, balances, expiration, or
        transactions, sweepstakes, promotions, or any emails, texts, or other
        communications with you, or arising out of or relating to any aspect of
        the transactions or relationship between us, whether based on contract,
        tort, statute, or common law, will be governed by the internal laws of
        the state in which you reside (except that, if you reside outside of the
        United States, the internal laws of the State of Colorado will govern),
        without regard to choice of law principles.</p>
      <p>12. Tax Matters</p>
      <p>You acknowledge and agree that we do not have
        the ability, in every instance, to determine whether or not the points,
        rewards, prizes, or credits you earned or redeemed in any Rewards
        Program
        are considered reportable taxable earnings in your jurisdiction. You are
        therefore responsible for any and all tax liability arising from or
        associated with your use of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services,
        including liability arising from your accrual of Rewards Program points
        or your redemption of such points for cash or other value. As a
        condition
        of your continued use of the FCC Sites and Features and our Services, we
        reserve the right to require you to provide necessary tax reporting
        information if our records show that you are or may be required to
        report
        the value of your points, rewards, prizes, or credits to an appropriate
        tax authority. We encourage you, and it is your responsibility, to seek
        advice of a tax expert in order to determine the tax consequences of
        your
        use of the FCC Sites and Features and our Services, and any associated
        points, rewards, prizes, or credits earned or redeemed.</p>
      <p>13. Notification of Changes</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to make changes to these
        Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we decide to change
        these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes by sending you an
        administrative email and/or posting those changes in places on the FCC
        Sites and Features deemed appropriate by us so our users are always
        aware
        of the terms of their use of the FCC Sites and Features and our
        Services.
        Your continued use of any of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services
        after delivery of the administrative email to you or after the changes
        are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes. If you do not
        agree
        to the changes, please discontinue your use of such FCC Sites and
        Features and our Services. To the extent that an arbitrator or court of
        applicable jurisdiction determines that applying any changes to these
        Terms to any prior events or circumstances would render this an illusory
        or unenforceable contract, such changes shall be applicable on a
        prospective basis only, with respect to events or circumstances
        occurring
        after the date of such changes, to the extent necessary to avoid these
        Terms being deemed illusory or unenforceable. In any event, if you used
        any of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services pursuant to a prior
        version of these Terms that required a certain notice period to you
        prior
        to any changes being effective, any changes under these Terms will not
        be
        effective as to you until the previously-specified notice period has
        passed after the date of these Terms.</p>
      <p>14. International Users</p>
      <p>The FCC Sites and Features are controlled,
        operated, and administered by the Company from its offices within the
        United States of America. The Company makes no representation that
        materials on the FCC Sites and Features are appropriate or available for
        use at other locations outside of the United States and access to them
        from territories where the contents or products available through the
        FCC
        Sites and Features are illegal is prohibited. You may not use the FCC
        Sites and Features or export the content or products in violation of
        U.S.
        export laws and regulations. If you access FCC Sites and Features from a
        location outside of the United States, you are responsible for
        compliance
        with all local laws.</p>
      <p>15. Excluded Users and Territories</p>
      <p>You are not permitted to download or use any
        of the FCC Sites and Features or our Services, including making any
        purchases of products or services from the Company, if you are (i)
        located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any
        country to which the United States has embargoed goods or services; (ii)
        identified as a &ldquo;Specially Designated National&rdquo;; or (iii)
        placed on the U.S. Department of Commerce&rsquo;s &ldquo;Denied Persons
        List or Entity List&rdquo; or any other U.S. export control list, or if
        the transaction would otherwise be illegal under any applicable law or
        regulation.</p>
      <p>16. Miscellaneous</p>
      <p>The Company&rsquo;s failure to exercise or
        enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed to be a
        waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms is
        found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
        the parties nevertheless agree that (except as otherwise provided in
        Paragraph 11) the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to
        the parties&rsquo; intentions as reflected in the provision or the
        provision shall be deemed severable, and the other provisions of these
        Terms remain in full force and effect. The paragraph or section titles
        in
        these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
        effect. These Terms represent the entire understanding of the parties
        regarding its subject matter, and supersede all prior and
        contemporaneous
        agreements and understandings between the parties regarding its subject
        matter, and may not be amended, altered or waived except in a writing
        signed by the party to be charged or as otherwise expressly provided
        herein. These Terms are binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of
        parties and their respective successors, heirs, executor,
        administrators,
        personal representatives and permitted assigns. You may not assign your
        rights or obligations hereunder without the Company&rsquo;s prior
        written
        consent, and any such unauthorized assignment shall be null and
        void.</p>
